# GOT ERROR AFTER FLAIR: (allennlp | transformers | flair)

# ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when 
# installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change 
# the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

# We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your
# packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

# allennlp 1.0.0 requires transformers<2.12,>=2.9, but you'll have transformers 3.0.2 which is incompatible.




#  (5) ---- tensor2tensor # PIP uninstalls / reinstalls: tensorflow-probability, hub and gan and medata and datasets and tensorboard .... etc.

# ## Problem Statement: 2.5.1 Earthquake Alarm
# **Example statement:** You have a new burglar alarm installed. It reliably detects burglary, but also responds to minor earthquakes. Two neighbors, John and Mary, promise to call the police when they hear the alarm. John always calls when he hears the alarm, but sometimes confuses the alarm with the phone ringing and calls then also. On the other hand, Mary likes loud music and sometimes doesn't hear the alarm. Given evidence about who has and hasn't called, you'd like to estimate the probability of a burglary alarm (from Pearl (1988)).

# ### Study: Independence Maps (I-Maps)
# * **Markov Assumption:** Bayesian networks require the assumption of **Markov Property**: that there are no direct dependencies in the system being modeled, which are not already explicitly shown via arcs. (In the earthquake example, this translates to saying there is no way for an `Earthquake` to influence `MaryCalls` except by way of the `Alarm`.  There is no **hidden backdoor** from  `Earthquake` to `MaryCalls`).
# * **I-maps:** Bayesian networks which have this **Markov property** are called **Independence-maps** or **I-maps**, since every independence suggested by the lack of an arc is actual a valid, real independence in the system.

# ## 4/ Inference in Bayesian Alarm Model
# So far we talked about represented Bayesian Networks.
#
# Now let us do inference in a  Bayesian model and predict values using this model over new data points for ML tasks.
#
# ### 1. Causal Reasoning in the Alarm Model
# For a causal model $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$, there are two cases:
#   * **Marginal Dependence:** ($B$ unknown): When $B$ is unknown / unobserved, there is an active trail between $A$
#   and $C$, meaning the probability of $A$ can influence probability of $C$ (and vice versa) when information about $B$'s state is unknown.
#   * **Conditional Independence:** ($B$ fixed): When $B$ is fixed, there is NO active trail between $A$ and $C$,
#   so they are independent. The probability of $A$ won't influence probability of $C$ (and vice versa) when $B$'s state is observed.

# $$
#
# When the middle node `Alarm` is unknown / unobserved, there IS an active trail between `Burglary` and `MaryCalls`. In other words, there is a dependence between `Burglary` and `MaryCalls` when `Alarm` is unobserved. This means the probability of `Burglary` can influence probability of `MaryCalls` (and vice versa) when information about `Alarm`'s state is unknown.

# ### 2. Evidential Reasoning in the Alarm Model
# For an evidential model $A \leftarrow B \leftarrow C$, there are two cases:
#   * **Marginal Dependence:** ($B$ unknown): When $B$ is unknown / unobserved, there is an active trail between $A$
#   and $C$, meaning the probability of $A$ can influence probability of $C$ (and vice versa) when information about $B$'s state is unknown.
#   * **Conditional Independence:** ($B$ fixed): When $B$ is fixed, there is NO active trail between $A$ and $C$,
#   so they are independent. The probability of $A$ won't influence probability of $C$ (and vice versa) when $B$'s state is observed.

# -----------------
# $I = 1, D = 1, S = 1$, and then marginalize over the other variables we didn't ask about (L) to get the distribution for the variable we asked about (G), so to get the distribution: $P(G \; | \; I = 1, D = 1, S = 1)$.
#
# But doing marginalize and reduce operations on the complete Joint Distribution is computationally expensive since we need to iterate over the whole table for each operation and the table is exponential in size to the number of variables. But we can exploit the independencies (like above) to break these operations in smaller parts, increasing efficiency of calculation.
#
# ### Variable Elimination
# **Variable Elimination:** a method of inference in graphical models.
#
# For our model, we know that the joint distribution (reduced using local independencies) is:
# $$
# \begin{align}
# P(D, I, G, L, S) = P(L \; | \; G) \cdot P(S \; | \; I) \cdot P(G \; | \; D, I) \cdot P(D) \cdot P(I)
# \end{align}
# $$
# **Example 1: Compute $P(G)$**
#
# Now say we want to compute the probability of just the grade $G$. That means we must **marginalize** over all other variables:
# $$
# \begin{align}
# P(G) &= \sum_{D,I,L,S} P(D,I,G,L,S) \\
# &= \sum_{D,I,L,S} P(L \; | \; G) \cdot P(S \; | \; I) \cdot P(G \; | \; D, I) \cdot P(D) \cdot P(I) \\
# &= \sum_D \sum_I \sum_L \sum_S P(L \; | \; G) \cdot P(S \; | \; I) \cdot P(G \; | \; D, I) \cdot P(D) \cdot P(I) \\
# &= \sum_D P(D) \sum_I P(G \; | \; D, I) \cdot P(I) \sum_S P(S \; | \; I) \sum_L P(L \; | \; G)
# \end{align}
# $$
# In the above expression, to simplify the sumation, we just brought the summation with respect to a particular variable as far as it could go (as inner-deep as it could go, without putting the summation with respect to the variable past the probability expression that included that variable)
#
# By pushing the summations inside we have saved a lot of computation because we now have to iterate over much smaller tables.


# TODO do the different kinds of inference from (Korb book): intercausal, diagnostic ... etc

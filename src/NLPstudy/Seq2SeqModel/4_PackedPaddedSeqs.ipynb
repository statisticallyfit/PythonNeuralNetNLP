    "### Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is the attention layer. The attention module is where we calculate the attention values over the source sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we allowed this module to \"pay attention\" to padding tokens within the source sentence. However, using *masking*, we can force the attention to only be over non-padding elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Pass of Attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive Definition of Attention Layer:**\n",
    "The attention layer takes in in the previous hidden state of the decoder, $s_{t-1}$ (what has been decoded so far by the `Decoder`) and also takes in all of the stacked forward and backward hidden states from the encoder, $H$ (all of what has been encoded so far by the `Encoder`).\n",
    "Then the attention layer uses these to produce an attention vector, $a_t$, that is the length of the source sentence, each element is between 0 and 1 and the entire vector sums to 1. The attention vector $a_t$ represents which words in the source sentence the `Decoder` should pay the most attention to in order to correctly predict the next word to decode, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula Definition of Attention Layer:**\n",
    "First, calculate the *energy* $E_t$ between the previous decoder hidden state and the encoder hidden states. As encoder hidden states are a sequence of $T$ tensors, and previous decoder hidden state is a single tensor, the first thing to do is `repeat` the previous decoder hidden state $T$ times. Then calculate the energy, $E_t$, between them by concatenating them and passing the result through a linear layer (`attentionLinearLayer`) and a $\\tanh$ activation function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_t = \\tanh(\\text{attentionLinearLayer}(s_{t-1}, H))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $H = \\{h_1, h_2, ..., h_T\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the energy calculates how well each `Encoder` hidden state \"matches\" the previous `Decoder` hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulaically, the paper says that the energy $e_{ij} = a(s_{t-1}, h_j)$ is an [alignment model](https://hyp.is/hTdBLBCEEeqNeLtcPGf5lQ/arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf) which scores how well the inputs around position $j$ and the output at position $i$ match. This score is based on the RNN hidden state $s_{i-1}$ (just before emitting $y_t$) and the $j$-th annotation $h_j$ of the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KEY FEATURES:** [The purpose of the alignment is to:](https://hyp.is/koZYmhCEEeqz0ytUsVvYvg/arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf)\n",
    "- compute a \"soft alignment\" which allows the gradient of the cost function to be backpropagated through. This gradient can be used to train the *alignment model* $e_{tj}$ as well as the whole translation model **jointly**.\n",
    "- later compute the probability $\\alpha_{tj}$ to implement an attention mechanism in the `Decoder`, so that the `Encoder` is relieved of the burden of having to encode all information in the source sentence into a fixed-length vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently have a **(`decoderHiddenDim`, `srcSentenceLen`)** tensor for each example in the batch. We want this to be **(`srcSentenceLen`)** for each example in the batch as the attention should be over the length of the source sentence. This is achieved by multiplying the `energy` by a **(1, `decoderHiddenDim`)** tensor, called $v$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{a}_t = v E_t$$\n",
    "where $E_t$ represents $e_{tj}$.\n",
    "This calculates a weighted sum of the \"match\" over all `decoderHiddenDim` elements for each encoder hidden state, where the weights are learned (while learning the parameters of $v$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to ensure the attention vector fits the constraints of having all elements between 0 and 1 and the vector summing to 1, it gets passed through a $\\text{softmax}$ layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_t = \\text{softmax}(\\hat{a_t})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the attention over the source sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE:** This is an adapted version of the energy $e_{tj}$ in the paper since in the paper, the energy is pushed directly through the softmax function, but here, we must first multiply by the $v$ vector to get correct dimensions.\n",
    "In the paper, the result of energy going through the softmax is the weight $\\alpha_{tj}$ of each annotation $h_j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_{tj} = \\frac{e^{e_{tj}}} {\\sum_{k = 1}^{T_x} e^{e_{tj}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphically, this looks something like below. This is for calculating the very first attention vector, where $s_{t-1} = s_0 = z$. The green/yellow blocks represent the hidden states from both the forward and backward RNNs, and the attention computation is all done within the pink block."

    "Previously we have only cared about the loss/perplexity of the model. However there metrics that are specifically designed for measuring the quality of a translation - the most popular is *BLEU*. Without going into too much detail, BLEU looks at the overlap in the predicted and actual target sequences in terms of their n-grams. It will give us a number between 0 and 1 for each sequence, where 1 means there is perfect overlap, i.e. a perfect translation, although is usually shown between 0 and 100. BLEU was designed for multiple candidate translations per source sequence, however in this dataset we only have one candidate per source.\n",

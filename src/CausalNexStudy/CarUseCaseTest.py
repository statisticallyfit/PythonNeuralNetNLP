# ## Learning the Structure
# Can use CausalNex to learn structure model from data, when number of variables grows or domain knowledge does not exist. (Algorithm used is the [NOTEARS algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01422)).
# * NOTE: not always necessary to train / test split because structure learning should be a joint effort between machine learning and domain experts.
#
# First must pre-process the data so the [NOTEARS algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01422) can be used.
#
# ## Preparing the Data for Structure Learning
# * $\color{red}{\text{ALERT: }}$ very important, MUST have the column names have nonoe of these characters: ?! - ; else will get error from the `InferenceEngine.__init__` function as: `"Variable names must match ^[0-9a-zA-Z_]+$ - please fix the following nodes: {0}".format(bad_nodes)`

# # 2/ Fitting the Conditional Distribution of the Bayesian Network
# ## Preparing the Discretised Data
# Any continuous features should be discretised prior to fitting the Bayesian Network, since CausalNex networks support only discrete distributions.
#
# Should make numerical features categorical by discretisation then give the buckets meaningful labels.
# ## 1. Reducing Cardinality of Categorical Features
# To reduce cardinality of categorical features (reduce number of values they take on), can define a map `{oldValue: newValue}` and use this to update the feature we will discretise. Example: for the `studytime` feature, if the studytime is more than $2$ then categorize it as `long-studytime` and the rest of the values are binned under `short_studytime`.
#

#               for v in dataVals['failures']} # 0, 1, 2, 3 (number of failures)
#studytimeMap = {v: 'short_studytime' if v in [1,2] else 'long_studytime'
#                for v in dataVals['studytime']}

# Once we have defined the maps `{oldValue: newValue}` we can update each feature, applying the map transformation. The `map` function applies the given dictionary as a rule to the called dictionary.
#discrData['failures'] = discrData['failures'].map(failuresMap)
#discrData['studytime'] = discrData['studytime'].map(studytimeMap)


# %% markdown [markdown]
# ## 2. Discretising Numeric Features
# To make numeric features categorical, they must first by discretised. The `causalnex.discretiser.Discretiser` helper class supports several discretisation methods.
# Here, the `fixed` method will be applied, providing static values that define the bucket boundaries. For instance, `absences` will be discretised into buckets `< 1`, `1 to 9`, and `>= 10`. Each bucket will be labelled as an integer, starting from zero.
#
# * $\color{orange}{\text{NOTE: not needed here}}$
# %% codecell
from causalnex.discretiser import Discretiser

# Many values in absences, G1, G2, G3

#discrData['absences'] = Discretiser(method = 'fixed', numeric_split_points = [1,10]).transform(data = data['absences'].values)
#assert (np.unique(discrData['absences']) == np.array([0,1,2])).all()


#discrData['G1'] = Discretiser(method = 'fixed', numeric_split_points = [10]).transform(data = data['G1'].values)

#assert (np.unique(discrData['G3']) == np.array([0,1])).all()

# %% markdown [markdown]
# ## 3. Create Labels for Numeric Features
# To make the discretised categories more readable, we can map the category labels onto something more meaningful in the same way we mapped category feature values.
#
# * $\color{orange}{\text{NOTE: not needed here}}$
# %% codecell

#absencesMap = {0: "No-absence", 1:"Low-absence", 2:"High-absence"}

#G3Map = {0: "Fail", 1: "Pass"}

#discrData['absences'] = discrData['absences'].map(absencesMap)

#discrData['G1'] = discrData['G1'].map(G1Map)
#discrData['G2'] = discrData['G2'].map(G2Map)
#discrData['G3'] = discrData['G3'].map(G3Map)


# Now for reference later get the discrete data values also:
#discrDataVals = {var: discrData[var].unique() for var in discrData.columns}

# Must train and test split data to help validate findings.

# %% markdown [markdown]
# # 3/ Model Probability
# With the learnt structure model and discretised data, we can now fit the probability distribution of the Bayesian Network.
#
# **First Step:** The first step is to specify all the states that each node can take. Can be done from data or can provide dictionary of node values. Here, we use the full dataset to avoid cases where states in our test set do not exist in the training set. In the real world, those states would need to be provided using the dictionary method.

# %% markdown [markdown]
# ## Predict the State given the Input Data
# The `predict` method of `BayesianNetwork` allos us to make predictions based on the data using the learnt network. For example we want to predict if a student passes of failes the exam based on the input data. Consider an incoming student data like this:
# %% codecell
# Row number 2
data.loc[2, data.columns != 'absenteeism_level']
# %% markdown [markdown]
# Here is the data again for reference. We see the absentee level is mid-range for this injury time `Electrical-Shock` and tool-type `Power-Gun` and process-type `Engine-Mount`
# %% codecell
data
# %% markdown [markdown]
# Based on this data, want to predict if this particular observation (worker) will have a high absence level.
#
# There are two kinds of prediction methods:
# * [`predict_probability(data, node)`](https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api_docs/causalnex.network.BayesianNetwork.html#causalnex.network.BayesianNetwork.predict_probability): Predict the **probability of each possible state of a node**, based on some input data.
# * [`predict(data, node)`](https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api_docs/causalnex.network.BayesianNetwork.html#causalnex.network.BayesianNetwork.predict): Predict the **state of a node ** based on some input data, using the Bayesian Network.

# # 4/ Model Quality
# To evaluate the quality of the model that has been learned, CausalNex supports two main approaches: Classification Report and Reciever Operating Characteristics (ROC) / Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
# ## Measure 1: Classification Report
# To obtain a classification report using a BN, we need to provide a test set and the node we are trying to classify. The classification report predicts the target node for all rows (observations) in the test set and evaluate how well those predictions are made, via the model.
# %% codecell
from causalnex.evaluation import classification_report

classification_report(bn = bayesNetCPD, data = data, node = 'absenteeism_level')
# %% markdown [markdown]
# **Interpret Results of classification report:** Precisions are very low for the no absentee level, and both precions and recall are very low for other absentee levels, implying we are likely to miss some of the predictions we should have made. Perhaps these missing predictions are a result of something missing in our structure
# * $\color{red}{\text{ALERT:}}$  explore graph structure when the recall is bad
#
#
# ## Measure 2: ROC / AUC
# The ROC and AUC can be obtained with `roc_auc` method within CausalNex metrics module.
# ROC curve is computed by micro-averaging predictions made across all states (classes) of the target node.
# %% codecell
from causalnex.evaluation import roc_auc

roc, auc = roc_auc(bn = bayesNetCPD, data = data, node = 'absenteeism_level')

print(f"ROC = \n{roc}\n")
print(f"AUC = {auc}")
# %% markdown [markdown]
# High value of AUC gives confidence in model performance, low value of AUC implies poor model performance.
#
#
#
# # 5/ Querying Marginals
# After iterating over our model structure, CPDs, and validating our model quality, we can **query our model under different observations** to gain insights.
#
# ## Baseline Marginals
# To query the model for baseline marginals that reflect the population as a whole, a `query` method can be used.
#
# **First:** update the model using the complete dataset since the one we currently have is built only from training data.
# %% codecell
# Copy object:
bayesNetFull = copy.deepcopy(bayesNetCPD)

# Fitting CPDs with full data
bayesNetFull: BayesianNetwork = bayesNetFull.fit_cpds(data = data,
                                                     method = "BayesianEstimator",
                                                     bayes_prior = "K2")
# %% markdown [markdown]
# Get warnings, showing we are replacing the previously existing CPDs
#
# **Second**: For inference, must create a new `InferenceEngine` from our `BayesianNetwork`, which lets us query the model. The query method will compute the marginal likelihood of all states for all nodes. Query lets us get the marginal distributions, marginalizing to get rid of the conditioning variable(s) for each node variable.

# %% codecell

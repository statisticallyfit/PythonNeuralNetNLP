# This is what we mean by a notion of similarity: we mean semantic similarity, not simply having similar orthographic representations. It is a technique to combat the sparsity of linguistic data, by connecting the dots between what we have seen and what we havenâ€™t. This example of course relies on a fundamental linguistic assumption: that words appearing in similar contexts are related to each other semantically. This is called the distributional hypothesis.

## Small example of how to make a word embedding

# Dictionary wordToIx is a mapping from words to indices

## index = the unique index for a word in a word embedding

## Embeddings are stored as: |V| x D matrix, where
### D = dimensionality of the embeddings such that the word
# assigned index i has its embedding stored in the ith
# row of the matrix
### |V| = dimension of the vocabulary V

wordToIndex = {"hello":0, "world": 1}

# 2 words in vocab, 5 dimensional embeddings
embed = nn.Embedding(2, 5)

# Getting the word embedding for the word "hello" using
# the lookup dictionary's index 0
lookupTensor = torch.LongTensor([wordToIndex["hello"]])
helloEmbedding = embed(autograd.Variable(lookupTensor))

print(helloEmbedding)

And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
Will be a totter'd weed of small worth held:
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
Proving his beauty by succession thine!
This were to be new made when thou art old,
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.""".split()
